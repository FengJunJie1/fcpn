## News
2018-08-31 The first version of FCPN is finished and internally used.<br>
2018-12-05  New stable version of FCPN is released.
## Background and introduction
Petri nets provide a formal and clear representation of systems based on their
firm mathematical foundation for the analysis of system properties. This software
provides fuzzy continuous Petri nets modeling and simulation functions
for researchers in the field of systems biology.
<br>
The purpose of this system is to provide users with services to complete
the simulation and fuzzy inference by constructing Petri nets. This software
includes three main functions: continuous Petri nets modeling, fuzzy modeling,
and hybrid simulation. Among them, the simulation is based on the transition
and fire of the Petri model input by the user, and the simulation results are
given.
<br>
In order to improve the user experience, we simplify the modeling page to
give users a more intuitive sense of use without affecting the function during the
design process. At the same time, the simulation and fuzzification are integrated
in the system, so that the usersâ€™ needs are satisfied as much as possible.
